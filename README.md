# MLSProject

This repository contains files related to the project work for Machine Learning and Statistics Module,


The investigations contained within the repository relate to the Boston House Prices dataset.  Python, scipy, keras and jupyter have been used to analyse the dataset.

The main work for this project is contained within the 'mlsproject.ipynb' file.  This is a jupyter notebook and can be run on any machine that has jupyter installed. Another useful way to view the file is by pasting the repository address in relevant box at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ The 'bostondata.csv' file contains the boston price dataset

The main aim of this project is as follows:

 - Use descriptive statistics and plots to describe the Boston House Prices dataset
 - Use inferential statiscs to analyse whether there is a significant difference in median house prices between houses that are along the Charles river and those that aren't
 - Use keras to create a neural network that can predict the median house price based on the other variables in the dataset
